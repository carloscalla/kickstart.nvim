# kickstart.nvim

## Introduction

My personal Neovim configuration.

A fork of [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)

**NOT** a Neovim distribution.

## Installation

### Install Neovim

Kickstart.nvim targets _only_ the latest
['stable'](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/stable) and latest
['nightly'](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/nightly) of Neovim.
If you are experiencing issues, please make sure you have the latest versions.

### Install External Dependencies

> [!NOTE] > [Backup](#FAQ) your previous configuration (if any exists)

External Requirements:

- Basic utils: `git`, `make`, `unzip`, C Compiler (`gcc`)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation)
- Clipboard tool (xclip/xsel/win32yank or other depending on the platform)
- A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/): optional, provides various icons
  - if you have it set `vim.g.have_nerd_font` in `init.lua` to true
- Emoji fonts (Ubuntu only, and only if you want emoji!) `sudo apt install fonts-noto-color-emoji`
- Language Setup:
  - If you want to write Typescript, you need `npm`
  - If you want to write Golang, you will need `go`
  - etc.

Via Homebrew:

```sh
brew install --cask font-ubuntu-mono-nerd-font
brew install git ripgrep lazygit ffmpeg fd imagemagick fzf gh ranger viu chafa bat
```

extra optional:

```sh
brew install go
```

Neovim's configurations are located under the following paths, depending on your OS:

| OS                   | PATH                                      |
| :------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| Linux, MacOS         | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim`, `~/.config/nvim` |
| Windows (cmd)        | `%userprofile%\AppData\Local\nvim\`       |
| Windows (powershell) | `$env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Local\nvim\`    |

### Install Kickstart

#### Recommended Step

[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repo
so that you have your own copy that you can modify, then install by cloning the
fork to your machine using one of the commands below, depending on your OS.

> [!NOTE]
> Your fork's URL will be something like this:
> `https://github.com/<your_github_username>/kickstart.nvim.git`

You likely want to remove `lazy-lock.json` from your fork's `.gitignore` file
too - it's ignored in the kickstart repo to make maintenance easier, but it's
[recommended to track it in version control](https://lazy.folke.io/usage/lockfile).

#### Clone kickstart.nvim

> [!NOTE]
> If following the recommended step above (i.e., forking the repo), replace
> `carloscalla` with `<your_github_username>` in the commands below

<details><summary> Linux and Mac </summary>

```sh
git clone https://github.com/carloscalla/kickstart.nvim.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim
```

</details>

<details><summary> Windows </summary>

If you're using `cmd.exe`:

```
git clone https://github.com/carloscalla/kickstart.nvim.git "%localappdata%\nvim"
```

If you're using `powershell.exe`

```
git clone https://github.com/carloscalla/kickstart.nvim.git "${env:LOCALAPPDATA}\nvim"
```

### Post Installation

Start Neovim

```sh
nvim
```

That's it! Lazy will install all the plugins you have. Use `:Lazy` to view
the current plugin status. Hit `q` to close the window.

Read through the `init.lua` file in your configuration folder for more
information about extending and exploring Neovim.

### FAQ

- What should I do if I already have a pre-existing Neovim configuration?
  - You should back it up and then delete all associated files.
  - This includes your existing init.lua and the Neovim files in `~/.local`
    which can be deleted with `rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/`
- Can I keep my existing configuration in parallel to kickstart?
  - Yes! You can use [NVIM_APPNAME](https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#%24NVIM_APPNAME)`=nvim-NAME`
    to maintain multiple configurations. For example, you can install the kickstart
    configuration in `~/.config/nvim-kickstart` and create an alias:
    ```
    alias nvim-kickstart='NVIM_APPNAME="nvim-kickstart" nvim'
    ```
    When you run Neovim using `nvim-kickstart` alias it will use the alternative
    config directory and the matching local directory
    `~/.local/share/nvim-kickstart`. You can apply this approach to any Neovim
    distribution that you would like to try out.
- What if I want to "uninstall" this configuration:
  - See [lazy.nvim uninstall](https://lazy.folke.io/usage#-uninstalling) information
